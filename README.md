# About

[Ronald McDonald Care Mobile](http://mchodessa.com/ronald-mcdonald-care-mobile/) a medical clinic on wheels servicing Odessa neighborhoods with unmet pediatric healthcare needs. This app offers a way to discover where and when they can receive treatment from the RMCM unit.

This will cater specifically to Houston.  The schedule is [here](http://texaschildrens.org/Locate/In-the-Community/Mobile-Clinic-Program/Ronald-McDonald-Care-Mobile-Clinic/).

# Installation
This is a Meteor project, so [install that](https://www.meteor.com/install) first. Fork and clone the repo, navigate to the project directory, and run `meteor --settings settings.json` from the command line. Check out [this article](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) for help on forking & contributing to open-source projects.

# Goals
1. Create a simple index page for viewing the RMCM Unit's schedule, including locations & times.
  - Automatically delete events that have already occurred.
2. Provide an admin backend through which RMCM staff can schedule and cancel events.
